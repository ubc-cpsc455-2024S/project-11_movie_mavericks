            other relevant details, and we'll provide you with tailored movie
            suggestions. Our recommendations are curated using a well-known API,
            ensuring you get the best picks suited to your taste.

            high-level information about each recommended movie, in a
            user-friendly way, such as the poster and synopsis, helping you
            decide what to watch next.

            Depending on time constraints and user feedback, we plan to expand
            our system to include TV show recommendations, transforming it into
            from a Movie Recommendation System to a Content Recommendation
            System. This way, you'll get the best of both worlds â€“ movies and TV
            shows tailored to your taste. We also plan on providing more inputs
            to the user to choose from that will help in providing more accurate
            recommendations.
